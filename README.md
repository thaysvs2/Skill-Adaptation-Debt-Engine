# Skill-Adaptation-Debt-Engine
A Streamlit dashboard that measures skill adaptation debt instead of predicting outcomes. It decomposes pressure into churn, novelty, and breadth to explain which roles/industries are becoming harder to staff. Includes role/industry reports, skill pressure maps, what-if scenario simulation, and a dataset explorer.
